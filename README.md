## Hi there, I'm Harry Hyunyoung Han 👋
🔭 I’m currently working on **KAIST (Korea Advanced Institute of Technology & Science)**. I have a passion for improving HCI and UX in XR and metaverse environments. I earned a degree(BS in Engineering) in computer science with a focus on artificial intelligence and management engineering from DGIST. For a year and three months, I conducted research in computer vision, including Pose Estimation and Human Re-identification.

For 1 year and 6 months, I worked as a PM at OnCloud9, a Web3 & Crypto Currency start-up, where I focused on designing and promoting interoperability in the blockchain and metaverse. As a researcher and PM, I have consistently aimed to align technology development with excellent UX for consumers. To this end, I regularly attend relevant seminars, such as those sponsored by UX LAB of Seoul National University, and engage in related research. I believe a fundamental HCI approach, which prioritizes user convenience in the XR-Metaverse connection process, is crucial for effective metaverse operation.

My ultimate goal is to **become an Insightful Tech Evangelist**. I aspire to stay ahead of emerging technologies, apply them strategically, and drive growth through informed decision-making.
